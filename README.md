# Dog attacks.

I created this website to show a dataset about animals that have bitten humans.
In this case it are all sort of dogs in the time period between 2015 to 2016

### UX

- As a user I want to be able to see which dog gender attacked the most.

- As a user I want to be able to click on a select menu that shows me the breed of dogs.

- As user I want to see which parts of the victims got attacked.(body, head, unknown)

- As user I want to be able to click on a select menu that shows me the gender of dogs.

- As a user I want to click on a button so everything resets.

- As a user I want to be able to see the website on different devices.
